Caesar Cypher

Playing around with cyphers. This is the caesar cypher that just shifts the plain text a number of characters along the alphabet.
<P>
So the 'normal' alphabet abcdefghijklmnopq... would look like fghijklmnopqrst if shifted 5 characters.
<>
The program excepts all printable characters.
<p>
encoding "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog 01234567890"
with a shift of 5 results in "ymjvznhpgwtBsktCozruxtAjwymjqfEDitl56789abcde5"
